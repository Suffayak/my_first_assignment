             <legend><button style="background-color: orange;">Carrot is good for your eyes.</button></legend>
            <p> This is probably the best-known carrot superpower. They're rich in beta-carotene, a compound your body changes into vitamin A, which helps keep your eyes healthy. And beta-carotene helps protect your eyes from the sun and lowers your chances of cataracts and other eye problems.
                Yellow carrots have lutein, which is also good for your eyes. Studies have found that it can help with or prevent age-related macular degeneration, the leading cause of vision loss in the U.S.</p>

            <p>Antioxidants have been proven to fight off harmful free radicals in your body, and that can make you less likely to have cancer. 
                The two main types of antioxidants in carrots are carotenoids and anthocyanins. Carotenoids give carrots their orange and yellow colors, while anthocyanins are responsible for red and purple coloring.</p>

                       Carrot are root vegetables that were first grown in Afghanistan around 900 AD. Orange may be their best-known color, but they also come in other hues, including purple, yellow, red, and white. Early carrots were purple or yellow. Orange carrots were developed in Central Europe around the 15th or 16th century.

            <legend align="center"><button><h3>To Plant, Grow, and Harvest Carrots</h3></button></legend>
            <p>Garden-grown carrots are full of flavor and texture! They are a popular, long-lasting root vegetable that can be grown in many climates.
              Learn all about planting, growing, and harvesting carrots.
              Carrots are easy to grow as long as they are planted in loose, sandy soil during the cooler 
              periods of the growing season—spring and fall (carrots can tolerate frost). 
              Depending on the variety and local growing conditions, carrots may take anywhere from 2 to 4 months to mature. 
              Plant them in the spring and summer for a continuous harvest through fall!</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>Gently mulch carrots to retain moisture, speed germination, and block the sun from hitting the roots directly.</li>
                  <li>When seedlings are an inch tall, thin so that they stand 3 to 4 inches apart. Snip tops with scissors instead of pulling them out to prevent damage to the fragile roots of the remaining plants.</li>
                  <li>Water at least one inch (about 1/2 gallon per square foot) per week to start, then two inches as roots mature.</li>
                  <li>Weed diligently, but be careful not to disturb the young carrots’ roots while doing so.</li>
                  <li>Fertilize with a low-nitogen but high-potassium and -phosphate fertilizer 5 to 6 weeks after sowing.</li>
